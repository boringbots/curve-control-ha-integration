# Curve Control Custom Card Installation Guide

## Overview
The Curve Control integration includes a custom dashboard card that provides an interactive interface for viewing and controlling your energy optimization schedule.

## Automatic Installation (Preferred Method)

When you install the integration, it will automatically:
1. Create the directory `config/www/curve_control/`  
2. Copy `curve-control-card.js` to that directory
3. Provide setup instructions in the Home Assistant logs

## Manual Resource Registration (Required)

After installation, you need to register the card as a frontend resource:

1. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Dashboards ‚Üí Resources**
2. **Click "Add Resource"**
3. **Enter the following details:**
   - **URL:** `/local/curve_control/curve-control-card.js`
   - **Type:** `JavaScript Module`
4. **Click "Create"**
5. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+F5)

## Adding the Card to Your Dashboard

1. **Edit your dashboard** (click the three dots ‚Üí Edit Dashboard)
2. **Add a new card** (click "Add Card")
3. **Select "Manual" card type**

## Troubleshooting
